# Wizybot Chat API

This is a fullstack technical assessment developed using **NestJS (TypeScript)** for the backend. It provides a chatbot API powered by **OpenAI's Chat Completion API** with support for two custom tools:

- `searchProducts(query: string)`: Returns two relevant products based on a user query, using data from a CSV file.
- `convertCurrencies(amount: number, from: string, to: string)`: Converts an amount between currencies using the **Open Exchange Rates API**.

## Tech Stack

- NestJS + TypeScript
- OpenAI Chat Completion API (Function Calling)
- Swagger for API documentation
- CSV parsing with `csv-parser`
- Open Exchange Rates API
- Dotenv for environment configuration
